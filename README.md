# Citadel

An ansible module that implements a simple secrets management store for teams and organizations, backed by Amazon's S3 and IAM APIs.

Inspired by [Noah Kantrowitz](https://github.com/coderanger)'s [poise/citadel](https://github.com/poise/citadel). [See here for his blog post](https://coderanger.net/chef-secrets/).

## Installation

## Configuration

### In your YAML files

### As a library

```python
class LookupModule(confu.ansible.S3LookupModule):
    bucket_var = 'citadel_bucket'
    profile_var = 'citadel_profile'
    region_var = 'citadel_region'
```

## Usage

Assuming your secret bucket is called `your-sekret-bucket`, you have proper permissions to read from it (via IAM or credentials, etc), and your secret structure in Amazon's S3 is as follows:

```
your-sekret-bucket
|-- newrelic
â”‚   |-- license_key
```

In your ansible playbooks:

```yaml
newrelic_license_key: "{{ lookup('citadel', '/newrelic/license_key').strip() }}"
```

When ansible processes the yaml files, it will evaluate the lookup function and will fetch the `your-secret-bucket/newrelic/license_key` key, read it and ansible will bind it to the `newrelic_license_key` variable.
